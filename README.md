# 🛠️ AI-Powered Image Analysis of Industrial Objects for Quality Assurance

An end-to-end automated quality inspection system using **YOLOv8**, **Python**, and **Raspberry Pi**, capable of identifying defective industrial components in real-time and rejecting them automatically with a servo-controlled mechanism.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Real-time object detection and defect classification using YOLOv8
- 📷 Live video feed processing from a USB camera
- 🤖 Automated rejection system using a servo motor
- ⚙️ Conveyor control using 12V DC motor and ultrasonic sensor
- 🧠 Edge device deployment on Raspberry Pi 4
- 💡 Cost-effective solution for industrial automation

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Object Detection**  
   A USB camera captures a live feed as objects move on a conveyor belt.

2. **YOLOv8 Analysis**  
   Each frame is processed using YOLOv8 to classify the object as `GOOD` or `DEFECTIVE`.

3. **Automation Logic**  
   - If `GOOD`: The object continues on the conveyor.
   - If `DEFECTIVE`: A servo motor pushes it off the belt.

4. **Ultrasonic Sensor**  
   Detects the presence of an object to trigger image capture and model inference.
